                    <p>
                        This blog post explains how I obtained a gym golden ticket by using my cyber security knowledge
                        in the entrance turnstile system used by more than 100 gyms across Turkey. Since I have a
                        sedentary job as a security engineer, I go to the gym regularly for a healthy life. A few weeks
                        ago, the owners of the gym completely transformed the place by rearranging things such as the
                        location of equipment, the sections of the locker rooms, the entrance method of the gym, etc. We
                        were using the ID card they gave us to enter the gym, but now the system has changed and it is
                        possible to enter with QR (Quick Response) code using a mobile app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To use this new QR entrance system, we need to do the following steps in order:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Download the gym’s mobile application</li>
                            <li>To log in to the mobile app we need to request login credentials(in the form of a QR code)
                                generated specifically for us from personal trainers.</li>
                            <li>Using the mobile application, we can trigger the turnstile system and enter the gym by
                                scanning the QR code on the turnstile's monitor.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3> Step 1: Download app </h3>

                    <p>
                        As a habit from CTFs for mobile application questions, I immediately opened the Android emulator
                        to test the gym mobile application and downloaded and installed the APK.
                        At the same time, I also decompiled the APK in hopes of finding forgotten secret information or
                        something interesting.
                        The application welcomes us as seen in the 2nd image.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgv" onclick="popmeup(this)">

                        <figcaption>Image 2</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h3> Step 2: Log in to the app </h3>

                    <h4> The HARDEST WAY </h4>

                    <p>
                        As you can see from the welcoming screen(Image 2) we have 2 options:
                    </p>

                    <h5> Login Method #1 : Add Account Manually </h5>

                    <p>
                        The application expects me to enter my account code to log in. There's a hint about where the
                        code is. `The account code can be sent to you by your gym, if you are a subscriber, in cases
                        where your camera is faulty and cannot read the QR code. The decision to send this code depends
                        entirely on the will of the gym you subscribe to.` Ok. Now, let's begin poking around the mobile
                        application a little bit and examining the traffic created by the mobile application using the
                        proxy setup I made with Burp. I first looked at the manual option (Image 3) because I had to
                        find only the account code.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">
                        <img src="/img/htg/addAccountManually.png">
                        <figcaption>Image 3</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        As you can see from the request, when I typed some random account code and click on the `Add
                        Account` button, the app sends the request above. Even if I change any parameters in the POST
                        body, the API server returns the same dummy JSON response to me till I give it the correct one.
                        After the application receives a response, even a fake one, from the API server, it directs us
                        to the home screen and adds a login button. However, if I click the login button, an information box
                        with the following warning message(Image 4) appears on our screen.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">

                        <figcaption>Image 4</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h5> Login Method #2 : Add QR Account </h5>

                    <p>
                        Let’s examine the other option which is ‘Add QR Account’. It opens the camera and expects a QR
                        code when I click on it.
                        To see what happens when the app reads a QR code, I generated a QR code from the response to the
                        manual account-adding request.
                        Surprisingly, the app is crushed when it detects the QR code. I couldn't find the root cause of
                        the problem, yeah it was a fun ending.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Time to dig deeper and look at the source code obtained from the decompiled apk of the mobile
                        application.
                        First of all, I looked for secrets such as sample account code or QR code.
                        I did not have any clue but I encountered a code snippet(Image 5) that extracts some keys for
                        account QR.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">
                        <img src="/img/htg/addaccountQR_sourcecode.png">
                        <figcaption>Image 5 (hellow)</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        I didn’t do any adding or removing lines in the source code.
                        All the gibberish debug purpose prints and comments belong to the mobile app developer and are
                        left behind in the application.
                        I have added translations of Turkish texts for you in the image I specified using white arrows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then I crafted another QR code using the `userId, qrLicense, userName, companyName, server` keys
                        of a JSON.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>
                            {"userId":"1", "qrLicense":"asd", "userName":"OKAN", "companyName":"GYM", "server":"mygym"}
                        </code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the application crashed again. I insisted on creating the necessary QR code for
                        adding accounts via QR to work properly.
                        In the decompiled apk, I found the piece of code(Image 6) below that shows all the keys I need.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">
                        <img src="/img/htg/qr_icerik.png">
                        <figcaption>Image 6</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        <code>
                            {"userName":"OKAN", "userId":"1", "qrLicense":"1", "urlProtokol":"http://", "server":"mygym", "qrFile":"mobile/checkuserqr.php", "companyName":"GYM", "companyPhone":"", "companyAddress":""}
                        </code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I recreated the QR code using the above JSON. The application was no longer crashing, but it was
                        not redirecting to the home screen and adding a login button.
                        Then I looked at the requests sent by the app, I noticed that the request (image 7) did not receive 
                        a response due to invalid domain name that was not resolved.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">
                        <img src="/img/htg/apiservice_accountadd-unknownhost.png">
                        <figcaption>Image 7</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        I turned back to the decompiled code.
                        I realized the application could not create a proper request because the data in the QR I
                        created was incorrect so I detected the faulty piece of JSON which was the server key.
                        According to Image 5, it must be a domain name because the code tokenizes the server key to
                        create cp_account and qr_server variables.
                        I crafted JSON that contains a qr_server key suitable for the app's tokenization.
                        Then, I got the ` SQLSTATE[HY000] [1049] Unknown database 'mg_xyz' ` error(image 8) until I
                        found the correct cpaccount.
                    </p>

                    <figure class="fgrimgh" onclick="popmeup(this)">

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Guessing the correct cpaccount took a little time.
                        While browsing through the resources I had, I found it in the QR on the turnstile screen that
                        allows us to enter the gym by scanning it using the mobile application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But this time I encountered the LicenseNotFound error. I needed to find the qrLicense or account 
                        code to log in to the app. I noticed that there is a file called syncDB. SQLite Database is used
                        to store user's information locally. It consists of functions that suffer from SQL injection.
                        When I saw poorly written SQL queries, I assumed that it might also be on the API server and
                        sent requests containing a malicious parameter that could cause SQL injection,
                        but I did not get any error from the API backend. Unfortunately, it didn’t work :(
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I turned back to examining the source code hoping to find a hardcoded account code or qrlicense
                        but couldn't find anything. I extracted all the links in the source code, thinking maybe I could 
                        find an API endpoint that was having a broken access control issue and could reveal the qrLicense 
                        or account code information. After all of the matches the links were collected, I prioritized a few 
                        notable links and created requests for the links as implemented in the source code. I was so lucky 
                        because using the third one I got amazing pieces of information(Image 11).

                        I was shocked because it was returning all kinds of information I need about a user.
                        The qrlicense was empty because a client with userid 1 had not yet defined the QR login but I
                        increased the userid fields one by one and after tens of IDs I got a valid qrlicense.
                        I created a QR code using the JSON below and I was in.

                    <p>
                        After I authenticated an account into the mobile application, I visited the host address in the
                        turnstile QR code via my web browser and encountered a login panel(Image 13).
                        Then I tried the first default admin credentials that came to my mind... and I was in the admin
                        panel. WTF.
                        Again and again, <b>the default username and password problem</b>. What can I do with this
                        panel?
                        Update my subscription expiration date, add money to my gym e-wallet... do whatever I want.

                    <p>
                        The same vulnerable turnstile system is used all around Turkey, so I developed a script called QRLorce to
                        enter gyms by abusing system flaws.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to the gym that uses the same turnstile system and scan the QR code displayed on the
                                turnstile screen to extract the domain name.</li>
                            <li>Exploiting the broken access control problem in Image 11, QRLorce sends requests by
                                incrementing the user numbers one by one to obtain valid qrlicence values.</li>
                            <li>To trigger the turnstile system, send the final request to the relevant API endpoint
                                with the necessary parameters.</li>
                            <li>And, I am in.</li>
                        </ol>

                        In this way, I can go into any gym that uses the same turnstile system and exercise free of charge.

                        (Security vs Usability)</a> I don't know the answer, but in this post, I explained how I bypassed the 
                        turnstile system that allows entry to the gym with a QR code. Also, I informed the relevant people 
                        and waited for them to fix this problems before publishing this blog post. Here is a video of breaking 
                        into the gym by exploiting this vulnerability using QRLorce.
